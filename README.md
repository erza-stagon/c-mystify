before starting, it is recommended to have a basic grasp of fundamentals of programming, in this case the C & C++ languages
i'll be using these websites frequently:
https://www.onlinegdb.com
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org
tools: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/
just download visual studio community for now
also, in the process of installation, do not install any plugins (including the ones that are for  c++ & OOP)
just do a plain install, it will be around 1GB
then just start typing your code by following these steps:
continue without code->file->new->text file
write a simple program using control_output {cout} command - its basically used to display outputs in the form of text
